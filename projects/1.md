## KRITA EXPORTER

### About the project

Although in some cases I'm using material painting programs such as Quixel, SP, etc., I decided to use Krita for most of my textures. Therefore I needed a fast way to export individual Krita Paint Layers as different RGBA channels.
My plugin prepares all required **Paint Layers** and **Groups** for specific type of RGBA textures. Currently for my project I'm using custom channel mixing to achieve visuals I'm going for without sacrificing performance.
Exporter manages export of *Diffuse, Mask, Detail mask* textures.

I was considering exporting textures directly to DDS format but since Unity3D has quite okay-ish UI for granular adjustments I decided against it. I might reconsider it for my next project to have even lower level of control.<br><br>
I might add some additional 'checks' which will be triggered during export to make this plugin more user-friendly. For example notifying user if they try to export textures with different template than the one they originally set. (i.e. trying to export *Diffuse* but current layout is ready to be exported as *Mask texture*.)

### Base functionality

Plugin has two types of buttons: *Create new Layers* and *Export*.
Create new Layers: While empty document this button creates a new *Paint Layers* and categorize them to proper *Layer Groups* with predefined names.
Export: Exports specific type of texture - *Diffuse, Mask, Detail mask*.
