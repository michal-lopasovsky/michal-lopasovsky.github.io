## SHADERS - COMBINED SHADER

### About the project
I was getting annoyed how most texturing programs out there work with "Roughness" pipeline but Unity's URP rendering pipeline is using "Smoothness" texture map. I decided to make my own shader.<br><br> One of the reason was also to add more features to this shader such as Detail map, which was not supported by URP's shaders. Additional problem I wanted to solve was to save some disk space and memory for textures. I achieved this by packing data textures to different channels and reducing this way the required amount of necessary textures.<br><br>Shader uses three textures to achieve better looking visuals and optimize performance. **Diffuse texture** which defines Albedo properties of a surface, **Mask texture** which is the most important because it defines how light influences surface and **Detail mask** for very small details which are visible only at up-close.<br><br>
For faster development process I made [Krita texture exporter]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/krita_exporter).

### Description

  <ins>DIFFUSE TEXTURE: </ins>It's a sRGB (Color texture) texture format. Base Albedo property of a surface. RGB channels are used for Albedo definition. If Alpha Channel is used it represents material's Alpha.<br><br>

  <ins>MASK TEXTURE: </ins>It's a Data texture format.<br>
  R - Metalness<br>
  G - Occlusion<br>
  B - Mask for detail map<br>
  A - Smoothness<br><br>
