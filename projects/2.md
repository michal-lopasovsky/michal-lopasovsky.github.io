## UNITY SCENE SELECTOR

### About the project
<p>Managing multiple scenes in Unity3D can be very slow and unorganized.</p>
I found myself often requiring to load and look at multiple scenes files at once. Either for adjusting continuality between scenes or for testing purposes where I needed to combine multiple test scenes to one while testing new gameplay features or mechanics. Multiple scenes can be added as *Addition Scenes*.

***

### Base functionality

<div class="ui right large floated rounded image">
  <img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/unity_scene_selector_config.jpg">
</div>

<ins>CONFIGURATION:</ins> Allows user to categorize their scenes based on naming convention and visually separate them in UI.<br>In my example I'm using *_test_* and *loc_* naming as categories for test scenes which are excluded from the build and locations which I main areas of the game.


<div class="ui right large floated rounded image">
  <img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/unity_scene_selector_b.jpg">
</div>

<ins>OPEN:</ins> Open this scene and unload any other currently added scenes.

<ins>ADD:</ins> Load this scene as *Addition*. Keep *Active Scene* loaded.

<ins>UNLOAD:</ins> Unload this scen. Keep any other scenes loaded including *Active Scene*.

<ins>SET ACTIVE:</ins> Set this scene as *Active Scene*. Keep any *Addition Scenes* opened.

<div style="background:#383838">
  <p style="color:#A7E8CE">Green: Active Scene<br>
  <span style="color:#F5CD61">Yellow: Addition Scene</span><br>
  <span style="color:#FF6E68">Red: Unload current scene</span></p>
</div>
