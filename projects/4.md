## VFX GRAPH - HOLOGRAM

### About the project
In my game, Player can craft different items in the crafting station. Therefore I wanted to show all the craftable items in an interesting way other than the usual 2D image on in-game LCD displays.

***

### Description
The final effect is made up of particles which are placed on top of  point cloud's positions. 2D data texture (point cloud) was generated out of actual in-game 3d meshes and then saved as 2D data texture - Unity has it's own .pCache format which is just an array of floats: *positions* and their *normal* information.

One more feature I want to implement in the future is to generate point clouds automatically from simlified LOD meshes.
