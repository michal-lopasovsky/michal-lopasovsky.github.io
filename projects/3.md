## FBX EXPORTER

### About the project
<p>I made this addon to have a better control over data exported from Blender to Unity3D. Additionally it improved speed of iterations.</p>
<p>Initially it started as very short script without any UI. But eventually I offered it to my friend who is also working in Blender and make his life easier I decided to update it and made an UI.</p>
Addon handles export of all meshes which are linked under an *export_node* (helper object). One *export_node* creates a one *FBX* file.
Other features were added such as custom properties which are processed by Unity3D's *AssetProcessor* while meshes are imported. Required fields such as name of the FBX file and export path are remembered within the .blender file.
Then additionally I added postprocessor script which is responsible for adding collider components on individual meshes in Unity3D or converting individual meshes to Unity Collider objects [BoxCollider, CyllinderCollider, etc.].

### Base functionality

<ins>Functionality is quite simple:</ins> Link all meshes that you want to export as a one object under *export_node*. You can do it either in 3d viewport or in *Scene Collection* panel, name your exported object (name of your FBX file), search export path and hit export button.

<div class="ui left large floated rounded image">
  <img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/exporter_images_tool_zoom.jpg">
</div>

*Name:* Name of FBX file<br>
*Path:* Where FBX file is going to be saved<br>
*isStatic:* Custom property<br>
*Export to FBX:* Button that exports meshes lined under this export node<br>
*Create a new export node:* When a mesh is selected in 3D viewport or in Scene Collection panel and thius button pressed, it creates a new empty export node in a position of this mesh.

<ins>Colliders:</ins> If user wants to export also collider objects together with the mesh they can do so by naming collider objects with specified suffixes: *boxcollider, capsulecollider, spherecollider, _coll*.

<ins>Flags:</ins> Additionally you can set *isStatic* boolean. This boolean sets a custom property to all objects under your *export_node* to *static*. When your object is imported to Unity3D this custom property is read and all objects with it are flagged by Unity3D editor as *Static*.

Static flag in Unity3D editor:
BatchingStatic, ContributeGI, ContributeGI, OccludeeStatic, OccluderStatic, ReflectionProbeStatic

Although FBX exporter is not responsible for seting any in-editor flags. `AssetPostprocessor.cs` is responsible for it:

```csharp
private void OnPostprocessGameObjectWithUserProperties(GameObject go, string[] propNames, System.Object[] values) {
    string metaKeyStatic = "isStatic";
    for (int i = 0; i < propNames.Length; i++) {
        if (System.String.Equals(propNames[i], metaKeyStatic) && (int)values[i] == 1) {
            GameObjectUtility.SetStaticEditorFlags(go, flags);
        }
    }
}
```
