    I'm able to recognize necessary tasks and manage them on my own but I'm very excited to work with a team of people. My experience is in building art pipelines, content optimization and performance monitoring, support for artists and engineers, building my own tools and improving in-house editor tools.<br><br> I have many interests and I like to stay up to date with new technology. People describe me as a T-shaped person, I've both depth and breadth in my skills.",
